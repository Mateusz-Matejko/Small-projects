# Always wining roulette strategy and details.

#### Notice: I have find out the mathematical strategy of winning roullete after finishing project, and during project I had no inspiration with it.

For past weeks, i was hardly thinking about working of roulette in Casino, and probability theory connected with it. I came up with an idea to beat the roulette with simply assumptions: 
- Infinite money for the player.
- No single bet limit for player.

I came up with idea that those simple assumptions combined with always double betting previous amount will lead to final success of beating the casino.
