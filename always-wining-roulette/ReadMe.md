# Always wining roulette strategy and details.

#### Notice: I have find out the mathematical strategy of winning roullete after finishing project, and during project I had no inspiration with it.

For past weeks, i was hardly thinking about working of roulette in Casino, and probability theory connected with it. I came up with an idea to beat the roulette with simply assumptions: 
- Infinite money for the player.
- No single bet limit for player.

I came up with idea that those simple assumptions combined with always double betting previous bet amount will lead to final success of beating the casino. 

### After successfully first few tries I decided for the following testing environment: 

- Staring bet : 1 - It's the bet player start game with
- Expected win : It's the minimal win that player will be satisfied with
- Reaserch sample : 1 milion tries. 
- Chosen color: Red - in final test, but code previously was checked for both black and red

#### For each one on bets information needed for further analysis was:

- No. of try
- lowest player wallet for turn
- try number needed to win
- red counter
- black counter
- green counter
- final_bet_money
- final_bet_turn
- total_money_spent
- won_amount
