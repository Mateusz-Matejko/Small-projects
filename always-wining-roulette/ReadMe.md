# Always wining roulette strategy and details.

#### Notice: I have find out the mathematical strategy of winning roullete after finishing project, and during project I had no inspiration with it.

For past weeks, i was hardly thinking about working of roulette in Casino, and probability theory connected with it. I came up with an idea to beat the roulette with simply assumptions: 
- Infinite money for the player.
- No single bet limit for player.

I came up with idea that those simple assumptions combined with always double betting previous bet amount will lead to final success of beating the casino. 

### After successfully first few tries I decided for the following testing environment: 

- Staring bet : 1 - It's the bet player start game with
- Expected win : It's the minimal win that player will be satisfied with
- Reaserch sample : 1 milion tries. 
- Chosen color: Red - in final test, but code previously was checked for both black and red

#### For each one on bets information needed for further analysis was:

- No. of try
- lowest player wallet for turn
- try number needed to win
- red counter
- black counter
- green counter
- final_bet_money
- final_bet_turn
- total_money_spent
- won_amount

### Data visualised:
I'am learning tableau :) 
- [Specific color values](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fgoi/viz/Roullettebreaking-Specificcolorvalues/Sheet1)
- [Final won amount with final bet corelation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fgoi/viz/Roullettebreaking-Finalwonamountandfinalbetcorelation/Sheet4)
- [Player wallet during game](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/fgoi/viz/Roullettebreaking-PlayerWalletduringandaftergame/Sheet3)

### Conclusion: 
This leads me to conclusion where this strategy is correct in mathematical.

With expected win set to above 100 Coins:
- the average win is over 1,3k  
- tha average lowest wallet per game was 39k
- the average total spent per game was 79k
- the lowest player wallet during game was 17 Trillion
- the highest win after game was 33,5 Million

Specific colors was rolled:
- red was rolled ( min: 2, max: 7, avg: 4.72)
- black was rolled ( min: 0, max: 29, avg: 4,72)
- green was rolled ( min: 0, max: 6, avg: 0,26

This startegy is 100% working but today's casino has
the limits of single bet amount so it's just fun fact
in the end of the day.
